    <h1>Interests</h1>
    Here's a lists of interests I have varying amounts of dedication in:
    <ul>
      <li>Rhythm games my beloved!!! I love tapping notes on my mobile device screen</li>
      <li>Making music is so cool I wish I was good at it</li>
      <li>Drawing is so cool I wish I was good at it</li>
      <li>Math... somehow I'm good at it. At least it's one less thing to worry about in school.</li>
    </ul>
